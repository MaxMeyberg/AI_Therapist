# Developer Culture ðŸ”§
- If youâ€™re working on a task, create an issue for it and assign it to yourself. Write updates as comments on your issue until you complete your task, upon which you can close your issue.
- If youâ€™re writing new code, create a branch with the naming format "FIRSTNAME-BRANCH-REASON" (for example, winson-cot-prompts). 
- The main branch should ideally never have any bugs, and represents our overall progress. When you want to merge your changes to main, submit a pull request and have another team member review your code prior to completing the merge.

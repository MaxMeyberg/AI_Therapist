Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Weâ€™re building Talk2Me, an affordable AI therapy solution which can serve as an on-demand, low-cost resource for crisis support, emotional expression, and preliminary mental health insights. Continue reading to learn how to run our agent!

# Project Setup ðŸ¤–

## 1. Obtain OpenAI/ElevenLabs API keys and set ElevenLabs audio agent ID

To run the agent, you'll need a OpenAI API key, ElevenLabs API key, and set the audio agent ID (aB08fUqZnmePxNvmkWTM).

Chat with the agent directly in the browser [here](https://elevenlabs.io/app/talk-to?agent_id=aB08fUqZnmePxNvmkWTM)

### a. Run the following commands in your shell to set the API key:

  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxx
  export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xxxxx
  export ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=aB08fUqZnmePxNvmkWTM
  ```

  Replace `xxxxx` with your actual API keys.

### b.  Save the API keys and audio agent ID in a .env file

  For a more permanent and secure setup, you can store your API key in a `.env` file and manage through the `python-dotenv` library. Follow these steps:

- Create a .env file

  At the root of this repository, create a file named `.env`

- Add the API Key to `.env`

  Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following line:

  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxx
  ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xxxxx
  ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=aB08fUqZnmePxNvmkWTM
  ```

  Replace `xxxxx` with your actual API keys.

- `.gitignore` file is already set up to ignore `.env` file by Git
  
## 2. Install Dependencies w/ Poetry

This project manages dependencies using Poetry. Follow these steps:

### a. Install Poetry (if not already installed)

If Poetry is not installed, you can install it globally using the following command:

  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
  ```

If you run into issues, check out the [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) for help.

### b. Install / update dependencies

Install all project dependencies by running:

  ```bash
  poetry install --no-root
  ```

# Running the Agent

## 1. Start the Backend

To run the agent, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you're in the root directory (for .env to properly load in the code) and run the agent in Poetry's virtual environment:

   ```bash
   poetry run python backend/run.py
   ```
  
2. To quit, press Ctrl+C or type 'exit'.

# Developer Culture ðŸ”§
- If youâ€™re working on a task, create an issue for it and assign it to yourself. Write updates as comments on your issue until you complete your task, upon which you can close your issue.
- If youâ€™re writing new code, create a branch with the naming format "FIRSTNAME-BRANCH-REASON" (for example, winson-cot-prompts).
- The main branch should ideally never have any bugs, and represents our overall progress. **Commits should only be pushed to main in the cases of (1) minor bug fixes or (2) markdown file updates.**
- When you want to merge your changes to main, submit a pull request and have another team member review your code prior to completing the merge. For cleanliness, make sure to delete your branch after it's been merged.
